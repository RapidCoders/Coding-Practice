# Q.1 Write a program that takes two strings, s1 and s2, as input and returns True if s2 is a rotation of s1, and False otherwise. A rotation means shifting all characters of one string to the right by any number of positions.
```
Input: s1 = "hello", s2 = "ohell"
Expected Output: True

Input: s1 = "python", s2 = "onpyth"
Expected Output: True

Input: s1 = "apple", s2 = "apple"
Expected Output: True

Input: s1 = "cat", s2 = "tacocat"
