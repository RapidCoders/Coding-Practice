// Q.1 Write a function that takes an array of integers and returns the length of the longest consecutive elements sequence.
// Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
// Output: 4 (the longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4])

// Input: [9, 1, 4, 7, 2, 8, 3, 5]
// Output: 5 (the longest consecutive elements sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])

// Input: [3, 3, 2, 2, 1, 1]
// Output: 3 (longest consecutive sequence is [1, 2, 3])

// Input: [10, 20, 30, 40, 50]
// Output: 5 (longest consecutive sequence is [10, 20, 30, 40, 50])
