# Q.2 Write a method to check and return whether given number is Spy Number or not.
```
Explanation:
A positive integer is called a spy number if the sum and product of its digits are equal.
In other words, a number whose sum and product of all digits are equal is called a spy number.

Example:
Let's take the number 1124 and check whether the number is a spy or not.
First, we will split it into digits (1, 1, 2, 4). After that find the sum and product of all the digits.
  Sum = 1 + 1 + 2 + 4 = 8
  Product = 1 * 1 * 2 * 4 = 8
We observe that the sum and product of the digits both are equal. Hence, 1124 is a spy number.

Input  : 132
Output : Spy number.

Input  : 217
Output : Not a Spy Number.
