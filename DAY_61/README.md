# Q.1 You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise). You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.
```
Input:
matrix = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
]
Output:
[
  [7, 4, 1],
  [8, 5, 2],
  [9, 6, 3]
]

# Q.2 Program to print all Disarium numbers between 1 and 100
**Explanation: A number is said to be the Disarium number when the sum of its digit raised to the power of their respective positions is equal to the number itself.**
```
For example, 175 is a Disarium number as follows
1^1 + 7^2 + 5^3 = 1 + 49 + 125 = 175

Output :
Disarium numbers between 1 and 100 are
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 89

# Q.3 Write a program to check the number is Armstrong Number or not.
**Explanation:An Armstrong number is a positive m-digit number that is equal to the sum of the mth powers of their digits. It is also known as pluperfect, or Plus Perfect, or Narcissistic number. It is an OEIS sequence A005188. Letâ€™s understand it through an example.**
```
153: 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125+ 27 = 153

125: 1^3 + 2^3 + 5^3 = 1 + 8 + 125 = 134 (Not an Armstrong Number)

1634: 1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4 = 1 + 1296 + 81 + 256 = 1643
