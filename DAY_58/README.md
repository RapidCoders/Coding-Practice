# Q.3 Write a program to check the number is spy number or not.
```
Input: num = 1124
Output:True

Explanation :
A positive integer is called a spy number if the sum and product of its digits are equal. In other words, a number whose sum and product of all digits are equal is called a spy number.
1+1+2+4 = 8
1*1*2*4 = 8
