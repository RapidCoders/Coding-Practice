// Q.2 Write a method to check and return whether given number is nude number or not.
// Explanation:
// A number is said to be nude number if all the digits of the number is the factor of that number.
// In short, nude numbers are those numbers that expose their factor.

// Example 1:
// 672 is a nude number because all the digits (6, 7, and 2) of the number are the factors of the number itself.

// Let's see another example.

// Example 2:
// 101 is not a nude number because all of the digits of the number 101, i.e., 1 and 0, do not divide the number 101.
// Observe that 1 divides the number 101, but 0 does not divide the number. Thus, we got at least one digit that does not divide the number 101.
