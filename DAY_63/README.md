# Q.1 Write a function that takes a string as input and returns a list of all the words in the string, separated by spaces.
```
Input: "Hello World"
Expected Output: ['Hello', 'World']

Input: ""
Expected Output: []

Input: "  This  is   a    test  "
Expected Output: ['This', 'is', 'a', 'test']

Input: "Hello, World!"
Expected Output: ['Hello,', 'World!']

Input: "123 456 789"
Expected Output: ['123', '456', '789']

# Q.2 Program to print all Disarium numbers between 1 and 100
**Explanation: A number is said to be the Disarium number when the sum of its digit raised to the power of their respective positions is equal to the number itself.**
```
For example, 175 is a Disarium number as follows
1^1 + 7^2 + 5^3 = 1 + 49 + 125 = 175

Output :
Disarium numbers between 1 and 100 are
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 89

# Q.3 write a program to count possible decoding of a given digit sequence.
```
1 = A, 2 = B, 3 = C, . . . . , 26 = Z.
The decoding programs are the most possible questions asked and are largely practiced in C  programming. The program counts the number of possible decoding’s of the entered digit by the user of the given sequence.
For example :- if the digit sequence is “12” then there are two possible decoding’s for this – One of them is ‘AB’ when we decode 1 as ‘A’ and 2 as ‘B’. Now we can also decode this digit sequence “12” as ‘L’ when we decode digits 1 and 2 taken together as an integer 12.

Now let’s take another example for reference,

Sequence = 131

Possible decoding (1, 3, 1,)    = ACA
Possible decoding (13, 1)   = MA
So, the total possible decoding’s of sequence 131 is 2.

Input: Enter the sequence : 141
Expected Output: Possible count of decoding of the sequence : 2.
