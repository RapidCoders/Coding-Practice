# Q.1 Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.
```
Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Output: [0, 1]
Explanation: nums[0] + nums[1] equals 9, so the answer is [0, 1].

Input: nums = [3, 2, 4], target = 6
Output: [1, 2]
Explanation: nums[1] + nums[2] equals 6.
