# Q.1 Write a program to check if a given number is a perfect square.
A perfect square is a non-negative integer that can be expressed as the product of an integer multiplied by itself. In other words, a positive integer \(n\) is a perfect square if there exists an integer \(m\) such that \(n = m \times m\).

For example:
- 1 is a perfect square because (1 = 1 times 1).
- 4 is a perfect square because (4 = 2 times 2).
- 9 is a perfect square because (9 = 3 times 3).
- 16 is a perfect square because (16 = 4 times 4).

# Q.3 Write a Program to check if number is Harshad number or not.
```
Input : num = 21
Output : True

it is divisible by its own sum (1+2) of its digit(2,1)
So it is Harshad's Number

Input : num = 31
Output : False

it is not divisible by its own sum (3+1) of its digit(3,1)
So it is not Harshad's Number
