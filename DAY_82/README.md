# Q.3 Given a non-negative number N and two values L and R. The problem is to toggle the bits in the range L to R in the binary representation of N, i.e, to toggle bits from the rightmost Lth bit to the rightmost Rth bit. A toggle operation flips a bit 0 to 1 and a bit 1 to 0. Print N after the bits are toggled.
```
Input:
N = 17 , L = 2 , R = 3
Output:
23
Explanation:
(17)10 = (10001)2.  After toggling all
the bits from 2nd to 3rd position we get
(10111)2 = (23)10

Input:
N = 50 , L = 2 , R = 5
Output:
44
Explanation:
(50)10 = (110010)2.  After toggling all
the bits from 2nd to 5th position we get
(101100)2 = (44)10
```
