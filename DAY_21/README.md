# Q.2 Program to check whether number is Krishnamurthy number or not.
```
Krishnamurthy number is another special number in Java. A number is said to be Krishnamurthy if the factorial sum of all its digits is equal to that number. Krishnamurthy number is also referred to as a Strong number.

Example : 
Number = 145  
= 1! + 4! + 5!  
= 1 + ( 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 ) + ( 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 )  
= 1 + 24 + 120  
= 145
