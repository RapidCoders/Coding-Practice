# Q.2 Write a method to check and return whether given number is Buzz Number or not.
```
Explanation:
Buzz number is another special number in Java that ends with digit 7 or divisible by 7. Unlike Prime and Armstrong numbers, the Buzz number is not so popular and asked by the interviewers.

In simple words, a number is said to be Buzz if it ends with 7 or is divisible by 7.

Let's take some examples of Buzz numbers.

42 is a Buzz number because it is divisible by 7.
107 is a Buzz number because it ends with 7.
147 is a Buzz number because it ends with 7 and also divisible by 7.
134 is not a Buzz number because it is neither end with 7 nor divisible by 7.
