// Q.3 Given two numbers M and N. The task is to find the position of the rightmost different bit in the binary representation of numbers. If both M and N are the same then return -1 in this case.
// Input: 
// M = 11, N = 9
// Output: 
// 2
// Explanation: 
// Binary representation of the given numbers are: 1011 and 1001, 2nd bit from right is different.

// Input: 
// M = 52, N = 4
// Output: 
// 5
// Explanation: 
// Binary representation of the given numbers are: 110100 and 0100, 5th-bit from right is different.
