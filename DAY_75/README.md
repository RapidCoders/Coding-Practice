# Q.3 Given two numbers M and N. The task is to find the position of the rightmost different bit in the binary representation of numbers. If both M and N are the same then return -1 in this case.
```
Input: 
M = 11, N = 9
Output: 
2
Explanation: 
Binary representation of the given numbers are: 1011 and 1001, 2nd bit from right is different.

Input: 
M = 52, N = 4
Output: 
5
Explanation:
