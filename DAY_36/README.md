# Q.1 You are given two sorted arrays, nums1 and nums2, where nums1 has enough space at the end to hold all elements from nums2. Write a program to merge nums2 into nums1 in sorted order.
```
nums1: [1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0], m: 3
nums2: [2, 5, 6], n: 3
Expected Output: [1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 6]

nums1: [], m: 0
nums2: [1, 2, 3], n: 3
Expected Output: [1, 2, 3]

nums1: [6, 5, 4, 0, 0, 0], m: 3
nums2: [3, 2, 1], n: 3
Expected Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]

nums1: [1, 2, 2, 0, 0, 0], m: 3
nums2: [2, 3, 4], n: 3
Expected Output: [1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4]

# Q.2 Program to chech whether Matrix is Trace Matrix.
Explanation:
The normal of a matrix is the square root of the sum of squares of all the elements of a matrix. For example, consider the following matrix.
        {9  8  2}
        {1  4  7}
        {3  5  6}
Normal and Trace of a Matrix in Java
First, we will calculate the sum of the square of each element.
92 + 82 + 22 + 12 + 42 + 72 + 32 + 52 + 62
81 + 64 + 4 + 1 + 16 + 49 + 9 + 25 + 36 = 285
Now, calculate the square root of the sum of squares.
âˆš285 = 16.8819430161

The trace of a matrix is the sum of all the elements present in the principal diagonal (upper left to lower right). Note that the matrix must be a square matrix (the number of rows and columns must be the same). It is useful to prove results in linear algebra. For example, consider the following matrix.
        {(9)  8   2}
        {1   (4)  7}
        {3    5  (6)}
Normal and Trace of a Matrix in Java
Trace for the above matrix is 5 + 4 + 7 = 16.
