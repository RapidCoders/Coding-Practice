# Q.1 Write a function that takes a string as input and returns the string with the first letter of each word capitalized.
```
Input: "HELLO WORLD"
Expected Output: "HELLO WORLD"

Input: "hEllo WorlD"
Expected Output: "HEllo WorlD"

Input: "a b c"
Expected Output: "A B C"


Input: "Hello, World!"
Expected Output: ['Hello,', 'World!']

Input: "123 456 789"
Expected Output: ['123', '456', '789']

# Q.3 write a program to count possible decoding of a given digit sequence.
```
1 = A, 2 = B, 3 = C, . . . . , 26 = Z.
The decoding programs are the most possible questions asked and are largely practiced in C  programming. The program counts the number of possible decoding’s of the entered digit by the user of the given sequence.
For example :- if the digit sequence is “12” then there are two possible decoding’s for this – One of them is ‘AB’ when we decode 1 as ‘A’ and 2 as ‘B’. Now we can also decode this digit sequence “12” as ‘L’ when we decode digits 1 and 2 taken together as an integer 12.

Now let’s take another example for reference,

Sequence = 131

Possible decoding (1, 3, 1,)    = ACA
Possible decoding (13, 1)   = MA
So, the total possible decoding’s of sequence 131 is 2.

Input: Enter the sequence : 141
Expected Output: Possible count of decoding of the sequence : 2.
