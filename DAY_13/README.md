# Q.1 Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return the indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target.
```
Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
Output: [0, 1]
Explanation: nums[0] + nums[1] equals 9, so the answer is [0, 1].

Input: nums = [3, 2, 4], target = 6
Output: [1, 2]
Explanation: nums[1] + nums[2] equals 6.

Input: nums = [3, 2, 9, 7], target = 4
Output: Not Found

Input: nums = [2,3,3,3,5], target = 6
Output: [1, 2]
Explanation: nums[1] + nums[2] equals 6.

# Q.3 Write a program which accept two numbers and check it is Friendly Pair or not.
```
Input :num1 = 30
       num2 = 140
Output : 30 & 140 are friendly pairs.

Input :num1 = 15
       num2 = 20
Output : 15 & 20 are not friendly pairs.

Friendly pair Explanation :(Sum of divisors of num1)/num1= (Sum of divisors of num2)/num2
