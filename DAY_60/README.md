# Q.1 You are given an n x n 2D matrix representing an image, rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise). You have to rotate the image in-place, which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. DO NOT allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.
```
Input:
matrix = [
  [1, 2, 3],
  [4, 5, 6],
  [7, 8, 9]
]
Output:
[
  [7, 4, 1],
  [8, 5, 2],
  [9, 6, 3]
]

# Q.2 Program to print all Disarium numbers between 1 and 100
**Explanation: A number is said to be the Disarium number when the sum of its digit raised to the power of their respective positions is equal to the number itself.**
```
For example, 175 is a Disarium number as follows
1^1 + 7^2 + 5^3 = 1 + 49 + 125 = 175

Output :
Disarium numbers between 1 and 100 are
1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 89

# Q.3 Write a program to check the number is Strontio Number or not.
**Explanation: Strontio numbers are those four digits numbers when multiplied by 2 give the same digit at the hundreds and tens place. Remember that the input number must be a four-digit number.**
```
1386*2=2772, we observe that at tens and hundreds place digits are the same. Hence, 1386 is a strontio number.
1221*2=2442, digits at tens and hundreds place are the same. Hence, 1221 is a strontio number.

Some other strontio numbers are 1111, 2222, 3333, 4444, 5555, 6666, 7777, 8888, 9999, 1001, 2002, 3003, etc.
