# Q.1 Write a function that takes a list of integers as input and returns another list where each element is the sum of the absolute differences between that element and all other elements in the list.
```
Input: [2, 4, 6, 8]
Output: [12, 8, 8, 12]
Explanation:
For the first element (2), the absolute differences with other elements are |2-4| + |2-6| + |2-8| = 2 + 4 + 6 = 12.
Similarly, for the second element (4), the absolute differences are |4-2| + |4-6| + |4-8| = 2 + 2 + 4 = 8.
The same process applies to other elements.

Input: [-3, -1, 0, 2, 5]
Expected Output: [18, 12, 11, 13, 22]

Input: [1, 1, 1, 1]
Expected Output: [0, 0, 0, 0]

Input: [9]
Expected Output: [0]

Input: []
Expected Output: []

# Q.3 Given an array of strings arr[] of length n representing non-negative integers, arrange them in a manner, such that, after concatanating them in order, it results in the largest possible number. Since the result may be very large, return it as a string.
```
Input: 
n = 5
arr[] =  {"3", "30", "34", "5", "9"}
Output: "9534330"
Explanation: 
Given numbers are  {"3", "30", "34", "5", "9"}, the arrangement "9534330" gives the largest value.

Input: 
n = 4
arr[] =  {"54", "546", "548", "60"}
Output: "6054854654"
Explanation: 
Given numbers are {"54", "546", "548", "60"}, the arrangement "6054854654" gives the largest value.
