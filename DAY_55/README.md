# Q.1 Write a function that takes a positive integer as input and returns the length of the longest binary gap. A binary gap is the longest sequence of consecutive zeros in the binary representation of the number.
```
Input: 15
Expected Output: 0  # Binary representation: 1111, no gap.

Input: 20
Expected Output: 1  # Binary representation: 10100, one gap between the 1s.

Input: 1048577
Expected Output: 19  # Binary representation: 100000000000000000001, longest gap between the 1s.

Input: 77
Expected Output: 2  # Binary representation: 1001101, two gaps between the 1s.

Input: 0
Expected Output: 0  # Binary representation: 0, no gap.

# Q.2 Program to determine whether a given number is a Deficient number
**Explanation :
The deficient number can be defined as the number for which the sum of the proper divisors is lesser than the number itself.
For example, the number 21 with its proper divisors (1, 3 and 7) has sum (11) lesser than itself.**
```
Input  : Enter the number : 21
Output : The number is deficient.

Input  : Enter the number : 12
Output : The number is not deficient.

Input  : Enter the number : 23
Output :The number is deficient.
