# Q.1 Write a function that takes a positive integer as input and returns the length of the longest binary gap. A binary gap is the longest sequence of consecutive zeros in the binary representation of the number.
```
Input: 15
Expected Output: 0  # Binary representation: 1111, no gap.

Input: 20
Expected Output: 1  # Binary representation: 10100, one gap between the 1s.

Input: 1048577
Expected Output: 19  # Binary representation: 100000000000000000001, longest gap between the 1s.

Input: "Shift", shift = 26
Expected Output: "Shift"

Input: "AbCdEf", shift = 1
Expected Output: "BcDeFg"

Input: "", shift = 5
Expected Output: ""
