# Q.1 You are given two sorted arrays nums1 and nums2, where nums1 has enough space at the end to hold additional elements from nums2. Merge nums2 into nums1 in sorted order.
```
Input: nums1 = [1, 2, 3, 0, 0, 0], m = 3, nums2 = [2, 5, 6], n = 3
Expected Output: [1, 2, 2, 3, 5, 6]

Input: nums1 = [1, 2, 3], m = 3, nums2 = [], n = 0
Expected Output: [1, 2, 3]

Input: nums1 = [0, 0, 0], m = 0, nums2 = [2, 5, 6], n = 3
Expected Output: [2, 5, 6]

Input: nums1 = [1, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0], m = 3, nums2 = [2, 4, 6], n = 3
Expected Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]


Input: "leetcode"
Expected Output: "leotcede"

# Q.3 Given a non-negative number N and two values L and R. The problem is to toggle the bits in the range L to R in the binary representation of N, i.e, to toggle bits from the rightmost Lth bit to the rightmost Rth bit. A toggle operation flips a bit 0 to 1 and a bit 1 to 0. Print N after the bits are toggled.
```
Input:
N = 17 , L = 2 , R = 3
Output:
23
Explanation:
(17)10 = (10001)2.  After toggling all
the bits from 2nd to 3rd position we get
(10111)2 = (23)10

Input:
N = 50 , L = 2 , R = 5
Output:
44
Explanation:
(50)10 = (110010)2.  After toggling all
the bits from 2nd to 5th position we get
(101100)2 = (44)10
```
