# Q.1 Write a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string where each character is shifted by a fixed number of positions in the English alphabet. For example, if the shift is 3, 'A' becomes 'D', 'B' becomes 'E', and so on.
```
Input: "Hello", shift = 3
Expected Output: "Khoor"

Input: "World", shift = -2
Expected Output: "Umpjb"

Input: "Coding", shift = 0
Expected Output: "Coding"
Input: "Shift", shift = 26
Expected Output: "Shift"
Input: "AbCdEf", shift = 1
Expected Output: "BcDeFg"

# Q.3 Write a program to Find GCD of Two Numbers.
```
Explaination: 
Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12

Factors of 8: 1, 2, 4, 8

Common Factors: 1, 2, 4

Greatest Common Factor: 4

Hence, the GCF of 12 and 8 is 4.

Input: num1 = 55
       num2 = 70
Output: the GCF of 55 and 70 is 5.

Input: num1 = 34
       num2 = 76
Output: the GCF of 34 and 76 is 2.
