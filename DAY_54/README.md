# Q.3 Write a program to Find GCD of Two Numbers.
```
Explaination: 
Factors of 12: 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12

Factors of 8: 1, 2, 4, 8

Common Factors: 1, 2, 4

Greatest Common Factor: 4

Hence, the GCF of 12 and 8 is 4.

Input: num1 = 55
       num2 = 70
Output: the GCF of 55 and 70 is 5.

Input: num1 = 34
       num2 = 76
Output: the GCF of 34 and 76 is 2.
