# Q.2 Write a program to check whether given number is Perfect number or not.
```
Explanation: 
Let's take the number 496 and heck it is a perfect number or not.

First, we find the factors of 496 i.e. 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 31, 62, 124, and 248. Let's find the sum of factors (1 + 2 + 4 + 8 + 16 + 31 + 62 + 124 +248 = 496). We observe that the sum of factors is equal to the number itself. Hence, the number 496 is a perfect number.

Input : Enter the number : 28
Output : 28 is a perfect number.

Input : Enter the number : 4558
Output : 4558 is not a perfect number.
