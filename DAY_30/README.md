# Q.2 Write a program to check whether given number is Fascinating number or not.
```
Example :
Let's take any number (n) say 327 and check whether the given number is fascinating or not. On multiplying the given number (n) by 2 and 3, we get:

327×2=654

327×3=981

Now, concatenate the above results to the given number (n).

"327"+"654"+ "981"= 327654981

We observe that the resultant () contains all the digits from 1 to 9, exactly once. Hence, the given number 327 is a fascinating number. Note that, we have not added the result to the given number. Some other fascinating numbers are 192, 219, 273, 327, 1902, 1920, 2019 etc.
