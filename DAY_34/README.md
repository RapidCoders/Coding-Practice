# Q.1 Given an array of integers, find the majority element. The majority element is the element that appears more than or equal to ⌊n/2⌋ times. Write a function to find the majority element. You may assume that the array is non-empty and the majority element always exists in the array.
```
Input: [3, 3, 4, 2, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4]
Output: 4

Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 9, 9, 9, 9]
Output: None.

Input: [2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]
Output: 2

Input: [3, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]
Output: None.

Input: [2, 2, 2, 1, 1, 3, 3, 3, 3]
Output: 3

# Q.2 Write a method to determine and return whether a given matrix is a sparse matrix.
**Explanation:**
**A matrix is said to be sparse matrix if most of the elements of that matrix are 0. It implies that it contains very less non-zero elements.
To check whether the given matrix is the sparse matrix or not, we first count the number of zero elements present in the matrix. Then
calculate the size of the matrix. For the matrix to be sparse, count of zero elements present in an array must be greater than size/2.**
```
Given Matrix : {4  0  0}
               {0  5  0}
               {0  0  6}

Number of zeroes present in above matrix is 6 and size of the matrix is 3 * 3 = 9.
Since, 6 > 4.5 that means, most elements of given array are zero.
Hence, the above matrix is a sparse matrix.

# Q.3 Write a Program to find the frequency of odd & even numbers in the given matrixt.
``` 
Input:  a[][] = {       
                        {4, 1, 3},    
                        {3, 5, 7},    
                        {8, 2, 6}    
                };
Output:
Frequency of odd numbers: 5
Frequency of even numbers: 4

```
